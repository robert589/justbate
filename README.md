Welcome to product development team :)

Rule:
<br>
1. Work progressively and efficiently, you do not have to spend all the time coding, just use 1-2 hour coding but focus when doing it <br>
2. Everyone is encouraged to learn both frontend and backend side (it is not hard when you want to learn, apparently, it only takes 1 day to learn), although you will specialize in either frontend and backend.
<br>
3. Ask google if there is a problem. If you still can not find it, you can ask others
<br>
4. Project share will be determined by how much you contribute to the project
<br>
5. Anything that you code here should not be shared to other people 
<br>
6. You can leave the project if you want to, please tell me if you feel you want to leave
<br>
7. If you have any idea how to improve the project, you can start an issue or update it in group chat
