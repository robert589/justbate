Project Rules <br>
Rules are not made to scare you but it is made so Each of us can contribute equally and rightfully to this group.


<b> 1. How does the project jobs are shared? </b>

Currently, You will be assigned the task by Robert Limanto. Further, the task for each of us will start to deviate and specialized.
My current plan is: Kelvin Chandra, Grace and Peter, Back End Developer
                    Vinsen Muliadi, Front End Developer
But it can change depends on the task available.

<b> 2. What can you do if you find errors that you cannot solve or problem that you cannot do? </b>

Create an Issue in this project and ask, https://github.com/robert589/startUp/issues

<b> 3. What can you do if someone does not contribute rightfully to the project ? </b>

For this time, Project Manager can kick anyone that is not contributed equally and rightfully. So, you could contact Project Manager (Current: Robert Limanto) for this. Any issue on this, please contact me directly or raise an issue

<b> 4. How does shares are divided among us? </b>

I saw how facebook actually divided their shares among the founder, cofounder and worker. the founder (Mark Zuckerberg) has 24 % of share in his company and the cofounder has aroung 5-7%. For now, I would divide 10% for each of you equally, but we will discuss this further after the app is launched since everything is clearer at that time. the 10% can be lesser since we also need to think how much the investor want from our share and how much you actually have contributed to the startup.
