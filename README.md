Project Rules <br>
Rules are not made to scare you but it is made so we can contribute equally and rightfully to this group.


<b> 1. How does the project jobs are shared? </b>

Currently, You will be assigned the task by Robert Limanto. Further, the task for each of us will start to deviate and specialized.
My current plan is: Kelvin Chandra, Grace and Peter, Back End Developer
                    Vinsen Muliadi, Front End Developer
But it can change depends on the task available.

<b> 2. What can you do if you find errors that you cannot solve or problem that you cannot do? </b>

Create an Issue in this project and ask, https://github.com/robert589/startUp/issues

<b> 3. What can you do if someone does not contribute rightfully to the project ? </b>

For this time, Project Manager can kick anyone that is not contributed equally and rightfully. So, you could contact Project Manager (Current: Robert Limanto) for this. Any issue on this, please contact me directly or raise an issue
