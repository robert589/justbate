Welcome to product development team :)

Rule:
1. Work progressively and efficiently, you do not have to spend all the time coding, just use 1-2 hour coding but focus when doing it
2. Everyone is encouraged to learn both frontend and backend side (it is not hard when you want to learn, apparently, it only takes 1 day to learn), although you will specialize in either frontend and backend.
3. Ask google if there is a problem. If you still can not find it, you can ask others
4. Project share will be determined by how much you contribute to the project
5. Anything that you code here should not be shared to other people 
6. You can leave the project if you want to, please tell me if you feel you want to leave
7. If you have any idea how to improve the project, you can start an issue or update it in group chat
