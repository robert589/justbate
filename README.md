<h1> Project Rules <h1> 
 Rules are not made to scare you but it is made so Each of us can contribute equally and rightfully to this group.


 1. How do the project tasks are shared? 

Currently, You will be assigned the task by Robert Limanto. Further, the task for each of us will start to deviate and specialized.
My current plan is: A.  Kelvin Chandra, Grace and Peter, Back End Developer <br>
                    B. Vinsen Muliadi, Front End Developer <br>
But it can change depends on the task available.

 2. What can you do if you find errors that you cannot solve or problem that you cannot do? 

Create an Issue in this project and ask, https://github.com/robert589/startUp/issues

 3. What can you do if someone does not contribute rightfully to the project ? 

For this time, Project Manager can kick anyone that is not contributed equally and rightfully. So, you could contact Project Manager (Current: Robert Limanto) for this. Any issue on this, please contact me directly or raise an issue

 4. How does shares are divided among us? 

I saw how facebook actually divided their shares among the founder, cofounder and worker. the founder (Mark Zuckerberg) has 24 % of share in his company and the cofounder has aroung 5-7%. For now, I would divide 10% for each of you equally, but we will discuss this further after the app is launched since everything is clearer at that time. the 10% can be lesser since we also need to think how much the investor want from our share and how much you actually have contributed to the startup.

 5. All projects, codes, assets are meant for this project only, you should not distribute the project codes, and assets outside this project
