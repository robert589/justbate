        <h2>  What is Justbate? </h2>
        <p>Justbate is a social opinion platform. Our aim is to create a healthier debating atmosphere by presenting every perspective equally. We understand that sometimes, great insights might lay in even the less popular opinions. So here, we embrace that and be rest assured, everyone gets the same spotlight.
        </p>
        <h2>Why we make this? </h2>
        <p>In other social medias, many different status updates may share one similar topic. Sometimes, comments get scattered and buried. By creating this platform, we try to combine all of them into one forum and opinions from different sides are presented altogether. We want to show a more complete view of each issue.
